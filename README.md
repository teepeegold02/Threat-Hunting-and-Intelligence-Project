# Threat-Hunting-and-Intelligence-Project
Sector-Specific Threat Intelligence and Hunting Using MITRE ATT&amp;CK and SOC Radar.


This project applies threat hunting and intelligence to the Information Services sector, aligning findings with MITRE ATT&CK, NIST CSF (Detect & Respond), and ISO/IEC 27001 controls.
It focuses on two APT groups — InvisiMole (UAC-0035) and Volatile Cedar (Lebanese Cedar) — to identify common adversary behaviors, build detection logic, and strengthen incident response.

Approach

Threat intelligence collected via SOC Radar (Free Version).

APT TTPs mapped using MITRE ATT&CK and visualized with ATT&CK Navigator.

Overlap analysis highlights shared techniques and guides detection priorities.

Key Outcomes

Mapped APT techniques across 14 ATT&CK tactics.

Identified common TTPs (purple layer) — e.g., Modify Registry, Process Injection, PowerShell Execution.

Built sector-specific detection logic and mitigation guidance.

Strengthened alignment with framework controls:

Framework	Alignment
NIST CSF (DE, RS)	Detect anomalous activity and support coordinated incident response.
ISO 27001 A.8.16–A.8.17	Event monitoring and detection.
ISO 27001 A.5.29–A.5.31	Incident response and learning.
